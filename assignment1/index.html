      he first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the website was
      its clean and minimalist design. The combination of black text on a white
      background made the content easy to read and focus on.

      The section of Myoungae Kim's website that I found most impressive was the
      "Main Page". This page hosts a Christmas events calendar, a feature that
      caught my attention. The calendar is not just a regular planner, it’s an
      interactive tool with 3D graphics that come to life with every click. Each
      day on the calendar reveals information about the artist, and on the right
      side, it shows a rich visual of a different project, with simple
      explanations that make you want to learn more. This new way of showing
      information kept me interested. It made me feel excited and eager as I
      looked at each project. The mix of nice-looking pictures and clear project
      details made my time on the website really engaging.

      During my 2 minutes interaction with the unique and festive Christmas
      calendar, I spent most of my time clicking on the detailed numbered
      windows. Each click revealed interesting facts about the artist's life,
      her inspirations, and various creative projects she has undertaken in her
      career. Each project was detailed, showcasing images, designs, and
      concepts that she has worked on during her creative journey. It felt like
      a short, but intriguing trip into Myoungae Kim's world, one window at a
      time!

    <h2 style="font-family: 'against'">Frustrating Part</h2>
    <p style="background-color: #9a5311; color: #e8e5e5; padding: 5px">
      The most frustrating part of the interaction is the loading time for the
      3D animations. If a user has a slow internet connection, the graphics
      might take time to load, which could disrupt the smooth interactive
      experience.
    </p>
    <h2 style="font-family: 'against'">Satisfying Part</h2>
    <p style="background-color: #9a5311; color: #e8e5e5; padding: 5px">
      The layout of the project, each click on a project name reveals new
      information, creating a sense of discovery and engagement. Also, the
      inclusion of 3D animations adds an element of surprise and delight to the
      UX, making the exploration of her work more memorable.

      The experience references several digital media forms such as layout,
      typography, graphic design, and 3D modeling. The website uses interactive
      3D graphics and animation, which are common in digital art and video
      games. The minimalist aesthetic and UI are in modern design. The website
      also references print media in the form of a calendar and portfolio, with
      each window acting like a page revealing new content.

        The interaction with the research experience should be curious and
        questioning. The use of interactive elements and different forms of
        media suggests users should be active participants, engaging with the
        content by clicking on links, scrolling through pages, and discovering
        new information. Moreover, encourages users to delve into the artist's
        world, explore her works, learn about her process and inspirations.

      The interactive elements, such as the 3D illustrates and the calendar,
      create a sense of curiosity. Each click reveals a new piece of information
      or a new project, which keeps the user interested and eager to explore
      more. The minimalist design and easy navigation make the experience

      artist's work inspires admiration and appreciation for her talent and
      creativity.

      I chose Misty White for the background of my web page as it provides a
      clean canvas that allows other elements to stand out, offers a calm and
      uncluttered backdrop that is easy on the eyes, enhancing readability and
      overall UX. For the text, I decided on Chocolate Brown, as it contrasts
      well with the White, ensuring the text is legible. The warm and earthy
      tone brings a sense of comfort which I believe will make the user feel
      more connected as they browse through the web!
